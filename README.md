# Biometry_II
This repository contains the code, files, and analysis for the final project of the Biometry II class taught by Nayel Bettache at Cornell University in Spring of 2025. With this project I aimed to evaluate if average screen time per day was significantly associated with various lifestyle and wellbeing metrics. The dataset includes the variables Age, Gender, Academic Level, Country, Most Used Social Media Platform, Sleep Hours Per Night, Relationship Status, Frequency of Conflicts over Social Media, and self-reported metrics including Social Media Addiction Score, Mental Health Score, and if Social Media Affects Academic Performance (Yes/No). I use linear modelling approaches combined with regularization, cross validation, and bootstrapping techniques to obtain confidence intervals for significant correlations, and discuss the broader implications of these results. The REQUIREMENTS file includes the packages and R versions used. The Students_Social_Media_Addiction file is the dataset used. The .html file is the knitted version of the included .RMD file which is the annotated code used to generate the results. IMPORTANT: The .RMD file opens a window with file.choose() that promps the user to select the .csv file corresponding to The Students_Social_Media_Addiction.csv file. THE USER MUST SELECT THE CSV FILE FOR THE CODE TO CONTINUE. The .html file includes a brief discussion and conclusions about the analysis done.
